# Changes in Version 1.0.0:
- all corruption functions accept images with arbitrary dimensions and aspect ratios
- corruption functions that convert the image to a byte-object will now also work for grayscale images
- reimplemented motion_blur and snow corruptions to remove the libmagickwand dependency
